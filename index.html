            Cricket is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of eleven players, originating in England in the 16th century. The game is played on a circular or oval field, with a 22-yard pitch at the center. Teams take turns batting and fielding, with the batting side aiming to score runs by hitting the ball and running between wickets. The fielding side aims to dismiss the batsmen through various methods, such as catches or bowled deliveries. Cricket has various formats, including Test, One Day Internationals, and Twenty20, each offering unique strategies and excitement.
